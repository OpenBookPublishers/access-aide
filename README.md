This project is _heavily influenced_ and inherits part of the code from the [Access-Aide](https://github.com/kevinhendricks/Access-Aide) LGPL v2.1 plugin developed for Sigil.

The plugin icon (`./icon/icon.png`) comes from the `adwaita-icon-theme` pack ([gitlab page](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme) of the project), released as LGPL v3 by the GNOME Project.
